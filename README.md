# Fitness App

## :page_facing_up: About
This project is a fitness app built using the CRUD method. It allows users to sign up for an account, log in to their account, and create fitness goals with an image. Users can also edit their goals and images. After setting up the goal and image, users can create a 7-day exercise routine. In each day of the exercise routine, the user can insert a comment, set up an exercise plan, fasting schedule, and dietary plan. The user can also upload an image as a URL and save each day as a favorite. Users can edit each day of the exercise routine.
